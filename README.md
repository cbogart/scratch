Now I'm going to make some references to the 171st issue in scisoft-net map:
- First by pasting the URL directly: https://github.com/cbogart/scisoft-net-map/issues/71
- URL without the s in https follows: http://github.com/cbogart/scisoft-net-map/issues/71
- Then by using just the number: #71
- Then by repo + number: scisoft-net-map#71
- Then by user + number: cbogart#71
- Then user + repo + number: cbogart/scisoft-net-map#71
- Then I'll try a url but substitute PR for issue: https://github.com/cbogart/scisoft-net-map/pull/71
